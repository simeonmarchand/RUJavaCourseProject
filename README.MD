# Project Overview

You are working as a software developer for a large insurance company. Your company is planning to migrate the existing systems from Visual Basic to Java and this will require new calculations. You will be creating a program that calculates the insurance payment category based on the BMI score.

### Your Java program should perform the following things:

1. [X] Take the input from the user about the patient name, weight, birthdate, and height.
2. [ ] Calculate Body Mass Index.
3. [ ] Display person name and BMI Category.
4. [ ] If the BMI Score is less than 18.5, then underweight.
5. [ ] If the BMI Score is between 18.5-24.9, then Normal.
6. [ ] If the BMI score is between 25 to 29.9, then Overweight.
7. [ ] If the BMI score is greater than 29.9, then Obesity.
8. [ ] Calculate Insurance Payment Category based on BMI Category.
9. [ ] If underweight, then insurance payment category is low.
10. [ ] If Normal weight, then insurance payment category is low.
11. [ ] If Overweight, then insurance payment category is high.
12. [ ] If Obesity, then insurance payment category is highest.
13. [ ] Implement exception handling.
14. [ ] Store all the information in the file.
15. [ ] Use an interface.
16. [ ] Use the concept of a queue and insert the patient details.
